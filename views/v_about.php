		<h2>About Documentary Educational Resources</h2>
		
			<p>Blabbr is the micro-blog project of Frank Aveni.</p>
			
			<p>Users can:
				<ol>
					<li>Sign up</li>
					<li>Log in</li>
					<li>Log out</li>
					<li>Add posts</li>
					<li>See a list of all other users</li>
					<li>Follow and unfollow other users</li>
					<li>View a stream of posts from the users they follow</li>
					<li>Upload a user image</li>
					<li>Delete their posts</li>
				</ol>			
			</p>
			
			<p>The site has a landing page, a navigation menu, and a note in the footer which identifies the two +1 features (numbers 8 and 9 above).</p>
			
			<p>The log in and sign up forms are checked for errors on the client side by HTML5, and on the server side by PHP and MySQL, preventing unauthorized log ins, and stopping existing users from signing up again (a prompt to log in is offered instead).</p>
			
			</p>Once logged in, the home page converts to a dashboard view which welcomes the user and offers him or her a list of things to do on the site.</p>
			
			<p>Users can add a new "Blabb" from the top of the "Blabbstream" page, or from within their profile page. Users are set to automatically follow their own posts by default, but this can be turned off in the user list. The logged-in user will see a button allowing them to delete their unwanted posts.</p>
			
			<p>The site has been checked as valid HTML5.</p>
			
			<p>Thank you to all the TF's and other students who helped me with this project.</p>
